= DevSecOps and Policy Enforcement with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

== Policy Management

RHACS has many built-in policies to detect activity related to attacker goals: gain a foothold, maintain a presence, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. The continuous runtime monitoring observes all container activity and will automatically respond to events with appropriate enforcement and notification. However, that would be missing out on an opportunity - RHACS wants to go one step further, to take advantage of containers' ephemeral, immutable nature to improve security in a measurable way from now on.

We want to use runtime incidents and vulnerabilities as a learning opportunity to improve security going forward by constraining how our containers can act. We achieve this by creating policies and implementing them early in the CI/CD process.

As we move into the next section, let focus on identifying and enforcing a runtime policy in the cluster. For the upcoming example, we will focus on stopping the Ubuntu package manager from being run in our cluster

.Procedure

. On the left-hand side of the application, click the *Platform Configuration* tab and *select* *Policy Management*.

image::images/policy-1.png[]

[start=2]
. Filter through the policies to find *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* or use the search bar to select by *category.*

image::images/policy-01.png[]

[start=3]
. Once you have found the vulnerability, *Ubuntu Package Manager Execution* on it to learn more.

[start=4]

. If you click the actions button, you will see how easy it is to edit, clone, export or disable these policies. We also recommended cloning the policies and adding or removing specific filters as you need them. 

---

==== Move on to the next RHACS module to see this policy in action at runtime


.Procedure
. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> Policy Management* and find the `Ubuntu Package Manager Execution` policy.
+
[TIP]
====
On the *Policy Management* page, type `Policy` + `Ubuntu` into the filter bar at the top.
====

. Select the policy `Ubuntu Package Manager Execution`.
. Click the `Actions`` button then click `Edit policy`.
. Select the `Policy Behavior` tab 
. Enable runtime enforcement by clicking the `inform and enforce button`
. Configure enforcement behavior by selecting `Enforce at Runtime`

. Click *Save*.

|===
Make sure to save the policy changes!!! If you do not save the policy the process will not be blocked!!
|===

=== Test Policy (Bookbag Environment)

Next, we will use `tmux` to watch OpenShift _events_ while running the test, so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

.Procedure
. On your student VM, start `tmux` with two panes:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach 
----

[start=2]
. Next, run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get events -w
----

[start=3]
. Press `Ctrl-b o` to switch to the next pane. (Ctrl+b THEN o)
. Run a temporary Ubuntu OS image using the `tmp-shell` application:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc run tmp-shell --labels="app=tmp-shell" --rm -i --tty --image ubuntu:18.04 -- /bin/bash
----

|===
NOTE: After the cluster pulls the image and starts the pod, expect to see a Linux command shell as shown.
|===

Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@tmp-shell:/#
----

*AND* 

[source,texinfo]
----
[~] $ oc get events -w

----

[start=4]
. Run the package manager in this shell:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
apt update
----

[start=5]
. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager performs an update operation:

Sample Output

----

[start=6]
. Examine the `oc get events` tmux pane (The pane on the bottom), and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]

----
+
After about 30 seconds, you can see that the pod is deleted.

[start=7]
. In your `tmux` shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the student VM command line

|===
NOTE: You can always type *exit* into the terminal or *reload the terminal* using the button on the top right of the workshop environment.
|===


*Sample Output*
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]
----

Congrats! You have successfully stopped yourself from downloading malicious packages! However, the security investigative process continues. 

You have raised a flag that needs to be triaged!

== Report and Resolve Violations

At this point, any attacker using a shell to install software is now disconnected from the environment.
A complete record of the event is available on the *Violations* page.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Filter by the policy violation `Ubuntu Package Manager Execution` OR by the most recent policy violations. You will see a policy violation the has been enforced 1 time.
. Click the most recent violation and explore the list of the violation events:

image::images/rhacs_runtime_violations_tmp-shell.png[RHACS run time Violations]

If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration, and is available to be retrieved via the API.
The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.

After this issue is addressed--in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action--you can remove it from the list by marking it as `Resolved`.

[start=4]
. Lastly, hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options and resolve this issue as operator error.

image::images/rhacs_runtime_violations_tmp-shell_resolved.png[RHACS Violation Resolved]

For more information about integration with SIEM tools, see the RHACS help documentation on link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.74/welcome/index.html#integrating-with-other-products[external tools^].
