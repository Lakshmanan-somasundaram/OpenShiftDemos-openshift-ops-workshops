## Installation and Verification

The primary method of installing OpenShift Container Platform is based on
Ansible playbooks. These playbooks ship as part of the product in the
`openshift-ansible` package.

This method has, in the past, been referred to as the `advanced installation
method` and it involves Ansible directly running the installation playbooks.
The advanced installer supports many configuration and customization options.
It also covers installation of supporting infrastructure like
OpenShift Container storage, logging and metrics components.

Your environment comes with a preinstalled cluster that has been deployed
using the installer's configuration file (`/etc/ansible/hosts`) when you
started the lab.

For more information on installing OpenShift Container Platform, please refer to
the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/install/quick_install.html[installation
section] of the product documentation.

[NOTE]
====
At this point you should be logged in as `cloud-user` on the OpenShift Master
node via SSH.

### Master Components

.OpenShift Master's 4 main responsibilities.
image::openshift_master_4_responsibilities.png[]


#### API/Authentication
The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the resources that make up a Kubernetes cluster.

Common things that interact with the Kubernetes API server are:

* OpenShift Web Console
* OpenShift `oc` command line tool
* OpenShift Node
* Kubernetes Controllers

All interactions with the API server are secured using TLS. In addition, all
API calls must be authenticated (the user is who they say they are) and
authorized (the user has rights to make the requested API calls).


#### Data Store
The OpenShift Data Store (etcd) stores the persistent master state while
other components watch etcd for changes to bring themselves into the desired
state. etcd can be optionally configured for high availability, typically
deployed with 2n+1 peer services.

[NOTE]
====
etcd stores the cluster's state. It is not used to store user application data.
====

#### Scheduler
The pod scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new pods onto
nodes within the cluster.

The scheduler is very flexible and can take the physical topology of the
cluster into account (racks, datacenters, etc).

#### Health / Scaling
Each pod can register both liveness and readiness probes.

Liveness probes tell the system if the pod is healthy or not. If the pod is
not healthy, it can be restarted automatically.

Readiness probes tell the system when the pod is ready to take traffic. This,
for example, can be used by the cluster to know when to put a pod into the
load balancer.

For more information on the OpenShift Master's areas of responsibility, please refer to
the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html[infrastructure components section] of the product documentation.

### Examining the provided Ansible inventory file
First, let's examine the provided installer configuration file.

#### Look at the file
Use `cat`, `less`, or an editor to look at the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file:

----
cat /etc/ansible/hosts
----

General settings and other variable information is defined on lines within the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section. There are also various host groups defined for things
like *Masters* and *Nodes*.

For more details on how OpenShift uses Ansible for its installation, please
refer to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install/configuring_inventory_file.html[Configuring Your Inventory File].

The top-level playbook in
`/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml` triggers
the installation of the cluster and all of it's components. It's idempotent,
which means you can execute this playbook multiple times without harm. This
also allows you to deploy additional components after the initial install by
simply modifying the configuration in `/etc/ansible/hosts` and re-run the
installer.

In addition to this, there are playbooks that only deploy a specific
component or service, which makes them faster to execute.

[TIP]
====
A typical multi-host installation like this might normally take around an
hour depending on the speed of your internet connection. Disconnected
installation options are also available. Prerequisites and other information
is all covered in the documentation.
====

### Verifying the Installation
Let's do some basic tests with your installation. As an administrator, most
of your interaction with OpenShift will be from the command line. The `oc`
program is a command line interface that talks to the OpenShift API.

During the OpenShift installation, the `root` system account on the `master`
host is configured to use a special OpenShift "super administrator" account.
Because of this, it is vitally important that you protect access to the
`root` system account, or remove this preconfigured config. Otherwise, anyone
who can `sudo` on the master has super user privileges on the entire cluster.

#### Login on the master
Additionally, your Linux system account on the master, `cloud-user`, is
preconfigured to access this OpenShift "super administrator" without a
password. Type the following command to login as the internal super-user on
OpenShift:

----
oc login -u system:admin
----

You will see that you got logged in to a project called 'default'. More on
projects later.

----
Logged into "https://master.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com:443" as
"system:admin" using existing credentials.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * default
    kube-public
    kube-system
    management-infra
    openshift
    openshift-infra
    openshift-logging
    openshift-metrics
    openshift-node
    openshift-sdn
    openshift-web-console
    storage

Using project "default".
----

#### Look at the Nodes
Execute the following command to see a list of the *Nodes* that OpenShift knows
about:

----
oc get nodes
----

The output should look something like the following:

----
NAME                                          STATUS    ROLES     AGE	VERSION
{{ INFRA_INTERNAL_FQDN }}    Ready     infra     1m	v1.10.0+b81c8f8
{{ MASTER_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready     master    1m	v1.10.0+b81c8f8
{{ NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready     compute   1m	v1.10.0+b81c8f8
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready     compute   1m	v1.10.0+b81c8f8
{{ NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready     compute   1m	v1.10.0+b81c8f8
----

All of the systems listed in the `[nodes]` group in the `/etc/ansible/hosts`
file should be listed here. 1 Infrastructure Node, 1 Master and 3 Worker nodes.

The OpenShift *Master* is also a *Node* because it needs to participate in the
software defined network (SDN).
The *Infra* node will only run workloads related to supporting OpenShift infrastructure.

#### Check the Web Console
OpenShift provides a web console for users, developers and application operators
to interact with the environment. There aren't many cluster administrative
functions to perform through the web console. Some OpenShift components (like
the internal image registry) run on top of the OpenShift environment,
and you can see these things. However, we have not yet explored authentication
topics, so you have no cluster administrator "human" accounts yet.

Point your browser to {{WEB_CONSOLE_URL}} to verify that the web console is
available and responding. You can login using the user `teamuser1` with password `openshift`.
You are not required to do anything in the web console at this point.

WARNING: You will receive a self-signed certificate error in your browser. When
OpenShift is installed, by default, a CA and SSL certificates are generated for
all inter-component communication within OpenShift, including the web console.
It is possible to provide your own SSL certificates during the installation, and
more information can be found in the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/certificate_customization.html#ansible-configuring-custom-certificates[custom
certificates] section of the installation documentation.

#### Prometheus
OpenShift is currently in the process of adopting Prometheus for cluster
infrastructure monitoring and alerting. At this time Prometheus is still in a Tech
Preview mode, with a non-production SLA. We encourage customers to explore
Prometheus and its alerts, and to provide us feedback.

More information about prometheus can be found in the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/cluster_metrics.html#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus
documentation] for OpenShift.

At this point, Prometheus is installed in your cluster. Until we configure
administrative users, there is not much to do with it, though. The user
authentication exercises will have you access Prometheus later, but, outside
of this there currently are not any exercises for interacting with
Prometheus. Look for these exercises to be added with the OpenShift 3.11
release.

Change to the `openshift-metrics` project:

----
oc project openshift-metrics
----

Now, `describe` the `StatefulSet` for Prometheus:

----
oc describe statefulset prometheus
----

You'll see something like the following:

----
Name:               prometheus
Namespace:          openshift-metrics
CreationTimestamp:  Mon, 09 Jul 2018 12:57:55 +0000

  Service Account:  prometheus
  Containers:
   prom-proxy:
    Image:  registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/oauth-proxy:v3.10.14
    Port:   8443/TCP
    Args:
      -provider=openshift
      -https-address=:8443
...
----

`StatefulSet` is a special Kubernetes resource that deals with containers
that have various startup and other dependencies. The key thing to note here
is that Prometheus is actually made up of several containers, including
authentication proxies (to secure it) and other components. There are six
total containers in the core Prometheus stack.

There is also a `node-exporter` container that runs as a `DaemonSet`. You can look at it by executing the following:

----
oc describe daemonset prometheus-node-exporter
----

You will see something like the following:

----
Name:           prometheus-node-exporter
Selector:       app=prometheus-node-exporter,role=monitoring
Node-Selector:  <none>
Labels:         app=prometheus-node-exporter
                role=monitoring

Pod Template:
  Labels:           app=prometheus-node-exporter
                    role=monitoring

      memory:  50Mi
    Requests:

      memory:     30Mi
    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:
      /host/proc from proc (ro)
      /host/sys from sys (ro)
  Volumes:

    Path:          /proc
    HostPathType:
   sys:
    Type:          HostPath (bare host directory volume)
    Path:          /sys
    HostPathType:
Events:            <none>
----

A `DaemonSet` is another special Kubernetes resource. It makes sure that
specified containers are running on certain nodes.

There are no labs for these, so feel free to check the documentation for link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSet] and for link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/daemonsets.html[DaemonSet].

Lastly, you can view that the Prometheus components have been exposed for access when outside of OpenShift using `Routes`. You'll learn about `Routes` later:

----
oc get routes
----

You will see something like the following:

----
NAME           HOST/PORT                                                                      PATH      SERVICES       PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
alertmanager   alertmanager-openshift-metrics.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}             alertmanager   <all>     reencrypt     None
alerts         alerts-openshift-metrics.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}                   alerts         <all>     reencrypt     None
prometheus     prometheus-openshift-metrics.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}               prometheus     <all>     reencrypt     None
----

We will briefly come back to Prometheus once we're able to log in to it.

#### Verify the Storage cluster
In your environment Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage was installed as part of
OpenShift. It will serve robust and persistent storage to both business
applications as well as OpenShift infrastructure. It is based on Red Hat
Gluster Storage, running in containers on OpenShift nodes and an additional
API server called `heketi` that enables the API integration with OpenShift.

We will now use a command line client on the *master* to talk via this server
to the container storage cluster. It's password protected, so let's export a
couple of environment variables first to configure the client:

----
export HEKETI_CLI_SERVER=http://heketi-storage-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}
export HEKETI_CLI_USER=admin
export HEKETI_CLI_KEY={{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}
----

Then use the CLI tool `heketi-cli` to query `heketi` about all the storage clusters it knows about:

----
heketi-cli cluster list
----

`heketi` will list all known clusters with internal UUIDs:

----
Clusters:
ec7a9c8be8327a54839236791bf7ba24 [file][block]<1>
----
<1> This is the internal UUID of the OCS cluster

[NOTE]
====
The cluster UUID will be different for you since it's automatically generated.
====

To get more detailed information about the topology of your OCS cluster (i.e.
nodes, devices and volumes heketi has discovered) run the following command
(output abbreviated):

----
heketi-cli topology info
----

You will get a lengthy output that describes the GlusterFS cluster topology as it is known by `heketi`:

----

----
<1> An internal GlusterFS volume that is automatically generated by the setup routine to hold the heketi database.

This output tells you that Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage currently
consists of a single cluster, which consists of 3 nodes, each with a single
block device `/dev/xvdd` of 50GiB in size. The GlusterFS layer will turn
these 3 devices/hosts into a single, flat storage pool from which OpenShift
will be able to carve out either distinct filesystem volumes or block devices
that serve as persistent storage for containers.
